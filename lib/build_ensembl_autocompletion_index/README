Builing the index for Ensembl Gene ID autocompletion
====================================================

Update Ensemble Data
--------------------
> cd Rails.root
> rake autocompletion:update # calls module GetEnsemblData

Most of the time, you will want to run this task. Deletes old data, downloads and saves to DB new.

Just in case, there are sub-tasks:
> rake autocompletion:delete # Delete only
> rake autocompletion:setup # Download and save to DB

In case of bugs
---------------
Double-check code is still up to date on ensembl.org:
- XML code as used in Curl call
    (getting all Ensembl gene ids in current release)
    Can be generated using BioMart
- Ruby
    (getting current release and getting all sequences)
    Can be generated using Ensembl REST server
