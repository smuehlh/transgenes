Builing the index for Ensembl Gene ID autocompletion
====================================================

Update Ensemble Data
--------------------
> cd Rails.root
> rake autocompletion:update # calls module GetEnsemblData

Most of the time, you will want to run this task. Deletes old data, downloads new data and saves it to DB.

Just in case, there are sub-tasks:
> rake autocompletion:delete # Delete only
> rake autocompletion:setup # Download and save to DB

In case of bugs
---------------
Double-check code is still up to date on ensembl.org:
- XML code as used in Curl call
    (getting all Ensembl gene ids in current release)
    Generate using BioMart (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart):
    1) select Database: Ensembl Genes
    2) select Dataset: Homo sapiens genes
    3) select Attributes: Ensemble Gene ID
        Deselect all other attributes!
        Deselect all filters (if any)!
    4) view "query in XML format"
    5) copy & paste to module GetEnsemblData
- Ruby code as used in call to REST server
    (getting current release and getting all sequences)
    Generate using REST API (http://rest.ensembl.org/):
    a_ getting current release
        1) GET info/data (http://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/data)
        2) copy & paste sample Ruby code to module GetEnsemblData
    b_ getting sequence per Ensembl Gene ID (as retrieved from XML query)
        1) GET sequence/id/:id
        2) copy & paste sample Ruby code to module GetEnsemblData
